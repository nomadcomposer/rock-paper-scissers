# Rock Paper Scissors (Console Version) 🪨📄✂️

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game playable in the browser console using plain JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open your browser.
2. Open the **Developer Console** (usually F12 or right-click → "Inspect" → Console tab).
3. Load the script file or paste the code into the console.
4. Use the `play("rock")`, `play("paper")`, or `play("scissors")` function to make a move.

## Example

```js
play("rock");
```

The computer picks randomly, and the result (win/lose/draw) is shown in the console.

## Files

* `script.js` – Contains all game logic.

## Notes

* No HTML or CSS needed.
* Great for beginners learning functions, conditionals, and random behavior in JavaScript.
